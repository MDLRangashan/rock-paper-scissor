Speech Recognition Module for Rock Paper Scissors Game
Author: [WNSD Fernando] (Developer 4)
Date: May 08, 2025
Description: This module implements speech recognition to detect the phrase
"Rock, Paper, Scissors, Shoot" as a trigger for starting a game round. It uses
the SpeechRecognition library with Google Speech Recognition API and includes
robust error handling and retry logic.
