Game Logic Module for Rock Paper Scissors Game
Author: [wwnsdsilva] (developer 5)
Date: May 08, 2025
Description: This module implements the game logic to determine winners in Rock Paper Scissors
(RPS) and Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock (RPSLS) modes. It includes a test suite to verify
all game scenarios (Win, Lose, Tie, invalid gestures).
